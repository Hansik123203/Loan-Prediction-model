# Loan-Prediction-model
## Objective
The purpose of this notebook is to build a predictive model for loan approval based on customer details such as income, credit history, and loan amount. The model aims to assist financial institutions in making informed lending decisions.
## Approach
The dataset is cleaned, preprocessed, and analyzed before applying a machine learning model to classify loan applications as approved or rejected. Feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning may be applied to enhance model performance.
## Machine Learning Model Used
The following machine learning model(s) were used for prediction: DecisionTreeClassifier
## Key Findings & Major Conclusions
The model provides significant insights into the factors affecting loan approval. Higher income levels and strong credit history positively influence loan approval, while high debt-to-income ratios may lead to rejection.
## Future Scope & Further Explorations
Further improvements can be made by optimizing hyperparameters, trying different feature engineering techniques, or using ensemble learning methods.
